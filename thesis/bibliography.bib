  abstract =	 {We describe a new training methodology for
                  generative adversarial networks.  The key idea is to
                  grow both the generator and discriminator
                  progressively: starting from a low resolution, we
                  add new layers that model increasingly fine details
                  as training progresses. This both speeds the
                  training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us
                  to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g.,
                  CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple
                  way to increase the variation in generated images,
                  and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in
                  unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe
                  several implementation details that are important
                  for discouraging unhealthy competition between the
                  generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a
                  new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms
                  of image quality and variation. As an additional
                  contribution, we construct a higher-quality version
                  of the CelebA dataset.},

                  learning tasks defined on \emph{sets}. In contrast
                  to traditional approach of operating on fixed
                  dimensional vectors, we consider objective functions
                  defined on sets that are invariant to
                  permutations. Such problems are widespread, ranging
                  from estimation of population statistics
                  \cite{poczos13aistats}, to anomaly detection in
                  piezometer data of embankment dams
                  \cite{Jung15Exploration}, to cosmology
                  \cite{Ntampaka16Dynamical,Ravanbakhsh16ICML1}. Our
                  main theorem characterizes the permutation invariant
                  functions and provides a family of functions to
                  which any permutation invariant objective function
                  must belong.  This family of functions has a special
                  structure which enables us to design a deep network
                  architecture that can operate on sets and which can
                  be deployed on a variety of scenarios including both
                  unsupervised and supervised learning tasks. We also
                  derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for
                  permutation equivariance in deep models. We
                  demonstrate the applicability of our method on
                  population statistic estimation, point cloud
                  classification, set expansion, and outlier
                  detection.},
